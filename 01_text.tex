\section*{Results}\label{s:results}

\subsection*{Citations and full size figures with legends underneath}

Text is added like this
This is a reference to a published paper \citep{watson_molecular_1953}.
We can cite other things too \citep{tipton_complexities_2019,zheng_genome_2011,alberts_molecular_2002}

This is a new paragraph.
New sentences on a new line.
New sentences on a new line.

% this is how to add a comment
This is a new result.
% this is how to add a figure with the name cells.
As you can see (\cref{fig:cells}).

% full size figure is figure*
\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/temp.png}
\caption{\textbf{These are cells.}\\
(\textbf{A}) This is a regular figure with a legend as a caption underneath. Inset: 3X zoom. Scale bar, \SI{10}{\micro\meter}.}
\label{fig:cells}
\end{figure*}

It is possible to add a one-column Figure like this (\cref{fig:nucleus}).
To add Supplementary Figures you can have them at the end of the end of the paper (Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:endosome}).

\section*{Discussion}\label{s:discussion}

This is the discussion section where you wax lyrical about your findings.
You can put your work in the context of other published work \citep{brenner_uga:_1967}.

\section*{Methods}\label{s:methods}

\subsection*{Molecular biology}

Details of plasmids are usually first.
Followed by cell biology section.
We have special units defied for molar and for units, e.g. \SI{1}{\Molar} sucrose, \SI{10}{\Units\per\milli\litre}.
Otherwise use siunitx for everything else. \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} and what-not.
